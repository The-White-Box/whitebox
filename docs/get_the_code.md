# Get the code: check out, build, and run WhiteBox

WhiteBox supports building on Windows, Mac and Linux host systems.

The process for building WhiteBox is generally the same on all platforms, but
each platform has a few quirks.  In order to keep you from having to jump
all over the place, we have a self-contained page for each configuration
you might want to build:

* [Linux](build/build_on_linux.md)
* [MacOS](build/build_on_macos.md)
* [Windows](build/build_on_windows.md)
